<p><strong>Each year, fires occurring during the holiday season  claim the lives of over 400 people, injure 1,650 more, and cause over $990  million in damage. According to the United States Fire Administration  (USFA), there are simple life-saving steps you can take to ensure a safe and  happy holiday. By following some of the outlined precautionary tips,  individuals can greatly reduce their chances of becoming a holiday fire  casualty</strong>. </p>



<p><strong><u>Selecting a Tree  for the Holiday</u>: </strong>Needles  on fresh trees should be green and hard to pull back from the branches, and the  needle should not break if the tree has been freshly cut. The trunk should be  sticky to the touch. Old trees can be identified by bouncing the tree trunk on  the ground. If many needles fall off, the tree has been cut too long, has  probably dried out, and is a fire hazard. &nbsp;</p>



<p><u><strong>Caring for Your Tree</strong></u><strong>:</strong> Do not place your  tree close to a heat source, including a fireplace or heat vent. The heat will  dry out the tree, causing it to be more easily ignited by heat, flame, or  sparks. Be careful not to drop or flick cigarette ashes near a tree. Do not put  your live tree up too early or leave it up for longer than two weeks. Keep the  tree stand filled with water at all times.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p><strong><u>Holiday Lights</u>: </strong>Inspect lights each year  for frayed wires, bare spots, gaps in the insulation, broken or cracked  sockets, and excessive kinking or wear before putting them up. Use  only lighting listed by an approved testing laboratory. <strong>Do Not Overload Electrical Outlets. </strong>Do not link more than three light strands, unless the directions indicate  it is safe. Connect strings of lights to an extension cord before plugging the  cord into the outlet. Make sure to periodically check the wires &#8211; they should  not be warm to the touch. &nbsp;<strong>Do Not Leave Holiday  Lights unattended</strong>.</p>



<p><strong><u>Holiday Decorations</u>: Only Use Non-flammable Decorations. </strong>All  decorations should be non-flammable or flame-retardant and placed away from  heat vents. <strong>Never Put  Wrapping Paper in a Fireplace. </strong>It can result in a  very large fire, throwing off dangerous sparks and embers and may result in a  chimney fire. </p>



<p><strong><u>Artificial  Christmas Trees</u>:</strong>If you  are using a metallic or artificial tree, make sure it is flame retardant. </p>



<p><strong><u>Candle Care</u>:</strong> <strong>Avoid Using Lit Candles</strong>. If  you do use them, make sure they are in stable holders and place them where they  cannot be easily knocked down. Never leave the house with candles burning. <strong>Never Put Lit Candles on a Tree. </strong>Do not go near a Christmas tree with an open flame &#8211; candles, lighters or  matches. </p>



<p><strong><u>Fire Place Safety</u>:</strong> Have  your fireplace inspected a minimum of once a year. Only burn hard wood, as soft  wood produces sap that builds up creosol in the flu. </p>



<p><strong><u>Space Heater Safety</u>: Each year in the United States, an estimated 2,000  people receive hospital emergency room care for burn injuries due to contact  with the hot surfaces of space heaters. About 600 people die each year in fires  that began with the careless use of space heaters. In addition, more than 100  people are killed annually by non-fire related carbon monoxide poisoning caused  by improper operation of space heaters. </strong></p>



<p><strong>For higher levels of safety when using space heaters,  follow these rules: </strong><br></br>
    <strong>• Keep a fire extinguisher handy and know how to use it. &nbsp;</strong><br></br>
    <strong>• Follow all instructions regarding proper installation  and operation of your heater. </strong><br></br>
    <strong>• Teach young children to stay away from heaters. Place a  protective cage around the heater if you have pets or very small children. </strong><br></br>
    <strong>• Turn off the heater when you go to sleep, when you leave  the room, and when you are not available to supervise your children.</strong></p>



<p><strong><u>Practice Your Home Escape  Plan</u>: It is important to teach your children the importance of  recognizing and responding when a fire alarm is sounding. Performing regular  mock fire drills at home will ensure that every family member will know what to  do. Drafting an evacuation plan that includes a pre-designated meeting area and  practicing it not only protects you and your family members, but it protects  firefighters, too. Firefighters are the men and women who, when others are  running out of the building, run in looking for individuals who may have become  overcome by smoke or flame.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Finally, as in every  season, have working smoke alarms installed on every level of your home, test  them monthly, and keep them clean and equipped with fresh batteries at all  times. Know when and how to call for help.</strong> </p>



<p><strong><font size="+1">Change your  clock, change your Smoke and Carbon-monoxide batteries.</font></strong><br></br><strong>Smoke alarms are still the  most effective way of preventing fire deaths in the home.&nbsp; Unfortunately,  far too many New Jersey  residents who have smoke detectors do not replace the batteries to guarantee  their continued operation. </strong></p>



<p><strong><font size="+1">Replace any smoke alarms older than 10 years and any CO detectors older than five years.</font> We often forget to do the small things in life that can make a difference like changing the batteries in  our smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors. The habit of changing these batteries  when we change our clocks back can go a long way towards preventing fire  injuries and deaths. Having a working smoke alarm doubles a family&#8217;s chance of  escaping and surviving a home fire. People should install, test and maintain  smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) alarms in their homes. <br></br> </strong></p>
