            <p><strong><font size="+2">Alarms:</font></strong>&nbsp;Smoke detectors are needed on each level of your home and especially outside of sleeping areas. They must work. Place them on the ceiling a minimum of 4 to 6 inches from the wall. Too many times the Fire Department has responded to a house without a working smoke detector.</p>


        <p>Change your smoke detector batteries (and carbon monoxide detector batteries) when you change your clocks. Carbon monoxide detectors are a must. Having a minimum of one in each sleeping area; and, as prices have dropped, all levels of the house is a strong recommendation. Carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless. A malfunctioning appliance or a nest on top of a chimney can be deadly. Other alarms such as gas detectors are now available. If you smell gas, get out and call 911.&nbsp; Specially designed detectors for the hearing or visually impaired are available for special situations.</p>


            <p><strong><font size="+2">Exits:</font></strong>&nbsp;Make a plan and do fire drills. Know at least two exits from each level of your home. Ensure that windows are operable and are big enough to get out of. A chain ladder may be needed for upper levels of your house. Practice setting up the ladder. I do not recommend that you practice going down it. (Save the practice for the fire safety trailer available at Monroe Day, the Oktoberfest, and all third grades during school hours. Basement sleeping is hazardous without an egress (escape window). Even a Bilco-type door can become covered with snow and will block your escape.&nbsp;</p>


            <p><strong><font size="+2">Plan:</font></strong>&nbsp;All household members need to know how to get out independently. Some fire drills should be conducted during sleeping hours and can help to determine family members that have a hard time or are slow to wake up. Use a spare smoke detector by holding down the test button to simulate a real fire. A flashlight by your bedside may be helpful, as fire is dark. Determine a meeting place such as a neighbor&rsquo;s front door or a tree in the front yard (away from the house). You can then determine any missing people and direct firemen.</p>


            <p><strong><font size="+2">Escape:</font></strong>&nbsp; When the alarm sounds, wake up household members and get out and stay out! Do not waste time getting valuables. If you see fire or heavy smoke or if the doorknob is hot, use a different way to get out.&nbsp; If you must turn around and use a bedroom window, use the escape ladder (climb down facing the ladder) or go out feet first facing the house, hang and drop. If you must go through smoke, stay low by crawling under the smoke. That&rsquo;s where the cool air is. The difference may save your life.&nbsp; Go to the meeting place and do not go back inside for any reason. Call from the neighbor&rsquo;s house or meeting place, not inside the burning building. Always call 911, even for the smallest fire that you thought you put completely out. The fire department can check behind the wall electronically for heat (not an axe) for any additional or extension of the fire.</p>
