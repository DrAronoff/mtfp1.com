        <p><strong><u>Help Us Help You</u>:</strong></p>



        <p><strong>When you changed your clock, did you remember  to change the batteries in your smoke and carbon-monoxide detectors?&nbsp; </strong></p>



        <p><strong>Watch where you put that cigarette out!&nbsp; As more and more smokers are smoking outside,  we are experiencing more and more fires that have started outside and have  ignited the outside structure of the building:&nbsp;  That is because the mulch or fertilizer that the cigarette is put into  is combustible!&nbsp;&nbsp; Use a metal bucket full  of sand for an ash tray.</strong></p>



        <p><strong><u>Give Way, Give Life</u>: When you see the Blue  lights of a First Responder on the way to the Station or the Red lights of an  Emergency Vehicle on the way to the scene, move over. When seconds count,  yielding makes a difference! </strong></p>



        <p><strong><u>Parking</u>: Be mindful of the “No Parking Fire Zone”  signs. Even when school is not in session the Fire Department still needs space  to gain rapid entry. Parking in a no parking zone in front of a strip mall may  hamper Fire Department operations or slow down an Emergency Medical Technician  from saving a life. </strong></p>



        <p><strong><u>Alarm Systems</u>: &nbsp;More and more homes have a fire alarm system  (smoke detectors) connected to an alarm company in conjunction with the burglar  alarm. In the event of a fire, the Fire Department is automatically called,  even if you’re not home. (Your pets will appreciate it!) With a quick alarm, a  small smoldering fire can be put out before it grows into a big fire.&nbsp; By the time your neighbors notice the flames  blowing out a window, major damage has occurred. </strong></p>



        <p><strong>For homes having an alarm system, the Fire  Department is offering a program where the home owner can purchase a safe-like  box (called a&nbsp;&nbsp; “Knox Box “) to be  cemented into your house and wired into the burglar alarm.&nbsp; The box contains a set of keys to get into  your house along with emergency contact numbers. In the event of alarm  activation, this allows the Fire Department to use a special key that only the  Fire Department has to gain rapid entry without taking an axe to your door or  window. This not only reduces damage but allows us to re-lock the door in the  event of a false alarm without you having to leave work.&nbsp; Stop by your local Fire House for details. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



        <p><strong><u>As the warm weather approaches, here are some  tips for using your propane grill</u>:</strong></p>



        <p><font size="5"><strong>Keep the grill a minimum of  5 feet from the structure of your home.&nbsp; Radiant  heat from the grill can ignite the side of the house, window covering, or the  leaves in your gutters!</strong></font></p>



        <p><strong><u>Propane Grill Do&#8217;s</u>:</strong> </p>



        <ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Always use the grill <strong>outdoors</strong> in a well-ventilated area. <strong>Do not bring propane cylinders indoors or into an  enclosed space</strong> such as a garage or basement.</strong></li><li><strong>Always follow all of the manufacturer&#8217;s  instructions and keep written materials and manuals in a safe, accessible  place.</strong></li><li><strong>Make sure the grill burner controls are turned off.  Keep the cylinder valve closed when not in use.</strong></li><li><strong>Make sure the gas grill is shut off and cooled off  before covering your grill after use.</strong></li><li><strong>Always use or store cylinders in an upright,  vertical position. Store them <strong>outdoors</strong> away from sources of  ignition.</strong></li><li><strong>When you have your cylinder refilled, have your  supplier check for dents, damage, rust or leaks.&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>&nbsp;After  filling, take your cylinder home immediately. Keep your vehicle ventilated with  the cylinder valve closed and plugged or capped. Do <strong>not</strong> leave the cylinder in your car.&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>When your grill is not in use, cover disconnected  hose-end fittings and burner air intakes with small plastic bags, or obtain  protective fitting caps from your propane supplier to keep out dirt, insects  and moisture.</strong></li><li><strong>Before lighting your propane gas grill burner, use  a leak-detection solution to check all connections for tightness. Contact your  local propane gas supplier to obtain the leak-detection solution and  instructions on how to use it.&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Never use matches or lighters to check for leaks.</strong></li><li><strong>If there is a significant and uncontrollable  release of gas or a fire, <strong>call the fire department immediately and move all  people and pets away from the unit. &nbsp;</strong></strong></li></ul>



        <p><strong><u>Propane Grill Don&#8217;ts</u>:</strong></p>



        <ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Do not smoke</strong><strong>&nbsp;while handling the propane cylinder.</strong></li><li><strong>Do not leave the cylinder in your vehicle</strong><strong>.</strong></li><li><strong>Do not use matches or lighters to check for leaks</strong><strong>.</strong></li><li><strong>Do not allow children to tamper or play with the  cylinder or grill.</strong></li><li><strong>Do not use, store or transport your cylinder where  it would be exposed to high temperatures. (This includes storing spare  cylinders under or near the grill.)</strong></li></ul>
