	  <h1><strong>Fire Prevention: Fourth Grade</strong></h1></center>
	
<p><strong>NOTE: Traditionally, there was not a formal assembly, just a presentation during the Safety Trailer experience. During COVID, this was done outside and students were sent in 2-4 at a time to experience the smoke conditions. Also, enclosed is an assembly presentation as needed, which is the first part of “Home Fire Evacuation”.</strong></p>
	<h2>Teacher's Instructions:</h2>
<p> Concept:</p>
	

<ol type="1">
  <li>Explain what exits are (windows and doors).</li>
  <li>What to do when the smoke detector goes off (wake up parents/caregiver and/or brother(s) and sister(s) and get out .</li>
  <li>Review the following concept and explain in an age-appropriate manner, as appropriate.</li>
  <li>Afterwards, click the video below.</li>
  <li><strong>After video, go to Getting Out Alive: Escape Plan/Home Fire Drills to reinforce concepts</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+2"><span >Video:</span> Home Fire Evacuation</font></p>
<p>(Insert playable Home_Fire_Evacuation.mp4 file here)</p>
<p>Make A Plan and do Fire Drills: Just Like in School! </p>
<p>Fire is dark, hot, and moves quickly, so you must have an escape plan. You have less than three or four minutes to get out before the smoke, temperatures, and carbon monoxide become unbearable. If you need assistance or have a family member with special needs (wheelchair, etc.), contact the Fire Dept. for a special plan.</p>
<p>As said before, know two ways out:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Know your Exits (Windows and Doors).</li>
  <li>Practice opening windows.</li>
  <li>Screens (in a real fire) just push out.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alarms: </strong>Smoke detectors are  needed on each level of your home and especially outside of sleeping  areas. They must work. Place them on the ceiling a minimum of 4 to 6  inches from the wall. Too many times the Fire Department has responded  to a house without a working smoke detector.</p>
<p><strong>Plan: </strong>All household members  need to know how to get out independently. Some fire drills should be  conducted during sleeping hours and can help to determine family members  that have a tough time or are slow to wake up. Use a spare smoke  detector by holding down the test button to simulate a real fire. Fire  is dark, so a flashlight by your bedside may be helpful. Determine a  meeting place such as a neighbor&rsquo;s front door or a tree in the front  yard (away from the house). You can then determine any missing people  and direct firemen.</p>
<p>Part of the drill should include instructions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Instruct family members: if there is smoke, stay low and go.</li>
  <li>Identify a meeting place for family members to assemble at outside,  such as a neighbor&rsquo;s front door or a tree in the front yard (away from  the house). You can then determine any missing people and direct firemen  accordingly.</li>
  <li>Instruct family members to NEVER go back inside once outside!</li>
  <li>Call 9-1-1 from outside the house or a neighbor&rsquo;s house, NEVER from inside the house!</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Escape:   When the alarm goes off, GET OUT! (Young Kids: don&rsquo;t hide from the Fire!)</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Escape:</strong> When the alarm sounds, wake up the household members, get out, and stay out!</p>
<p>Time: You don&rsquo;t have time! </p>
<ul>
  <li>Just Enough Time to wake up the family and Get Out!
    <ul>
      <li>Pets get out by themselves, as they are low to the ground.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>No time for toys, valuables, or purses.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fire goes from 100 degrees to 400 – 1000 in the first three or four minutes of a fire.</li>
  <li>Do not waste time getting valuables. If you see fire or heavy smoke,  or if the doorknob is hot, keep the door shut and use a different way  to get out. </li>
  <li>If you must turn around and use a bedroom window, use the escape  ladder (climb down facing the ladder) or go out feet first facing the  house, hang  and drop. </li>
  <li>If you must go through smoke, stay low by crawling under the smoke.  That&rsquo;s where the cool air is. The difference may save your life!</li>
  <li>Close doors behind you to stop the spread of Fire.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay low and go: That&rsquo;s where the cool air is, near the floor. That&rsquo;s also why pets get out and survive. </p>
<p><strong>Seaton Hall  College Dorm Fire</strong><br></br>
  Two college roommates escaped the Seaton Hall Dorm Fire.<br></br>
  One ran and the other remembered her Fire Prevention training and crawled. <br></br>
  The first went to St. Barnabus with burns to their throat and lungs.<br></br>
  The one who crawled was treated and released the same day.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Try getting out the usual way. If there is heavy smoke or fire, or  if the door knob is hot, keep the door shut and again, find another  exit.</li>
  <li>If you can&rsquo;t get out of bedroom, keep the door shut and go to a  window. Open the window (unless fire is below window) and wait for fire  fighters. </li>
</ul>
<p>Monroe  House  Fire</p><br></br>
  Two kids escaped a house fire in Monroe.<br></br>
  A space heater caught a vacuum cleaner on fire. <br></br>
  A smoke detector alarm went off.<br></br>
  The teenage boy and girl tried to go downstairs and saw smoke and fire.<br></br>
  Just  as they were taught, they opened a window (no ladder), pushed out the  screen, hung out the window, and dropped. Both kids were ok (aside from  the girl having a minor sprained ankle). 
  The house was totally  destroyed.<br></br><p>
  They survived because they did everything right !</p>
<p>Carbon Monoxide Detectors:</p>
<p><em>Carbon Monoxide is colorless, odorless, tasteless and extremely harmful.</em></p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t see it, smell it, or taste it.</p>
<p><em><u>Adults Only Tips:</u></em></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Test Carbon Monoxide detectors monthly.</em></li>
  <li><em>Make sure you have at least one carbon monoxide detector on every level of the house</em></li>
  <li><em>Replace every five years unless it contains newer non-replaceable battery as noted above.</em></li>
  <li>In the event of a fire, use the ladder with one adult and have the  children go first. If there are two adults, one adult goes first, then  the children, then the second adult last.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><u>Adults Only Tip:</u></em></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Basement sleeping is hazardous without an egress (escape  window). Even a Bilco-type door can become covered with snow and will  block your escape.</em></li>
  <li>If you must get out through a window (if smoke is unbearable/last resort) but you don&rsquo;t have a ladder:
    <ul>
      <li>Most home 2nd floor windows are less than a 16 foot drop.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Teach family members how to hang like on a jungle gym facing the building, dropping feet first, never jumping head-first.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once outside, go to the meeting place and NEVER go back inside.</li>
  <li>Call 9-1-1 from outside building or a neighbor&rsquo;s house, never from inside the house.</li>
  <li>Determine if anyone is missing and direct Fire Dept.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note:  Firefighters sometimes risk their lives searching for people who are already out of the building.</p>
<p>Smoke Trailer Escape (True Story):<br></br>
  Explain that two kids escaped a house fire in Monroe.<br></br>
  A space heater caught a vacuum cleaner on fire. <br></br>
  A smoke detector alarm went off.<br></br>
  The teenage boy and girl tried to go downstairs and saw smoke and fire.<br></br>
  Just  as they were taught, they opened a window (no ladder), pushed out the  screen, hung out the window, and dropped. Both kids were ok (aside from  the girl having a minor sprained ankle). 
  The house was totally  destroyed.<br></br>
  They survived because they did everything right and didn&rsquo;t lose their cool. </p>
<h1><strong>Smoke Drill/ Safety First!:</strong></h1>
<hr></hr>
<ul>
  <li>Explain that you are going to recreate the Monroe Fire Incident as described in &ldquo;Getting Out Alive&rdquo; above.</li>
  <li>Teach how to use the ladder (Just like a pool ladder).</li>
  <li>Face trailer / house </li>
  <li>Two hands and at least one foot on the ladder, (three points just like fire school).</li>
  <li>Children are instructed to crawl when smoke alarm goes off, going to  the upstairs window, turning to the ladder facing the trailer (one at a  time), and go down.</li>
  <li>Have someone at the top of the ladder directing the children, as well as crew at base of the ladder.</li>
  <li>Children are to be directly supervised always.</li>
  <li>Don&rsquo;t touch the children unless you have to, but under the same token, assist as necessary if you feel there is a safety issue.</li>
