            <p>You may hear our sirens! The purpose of the sirens are to alert the  Volunteer Fire Department members of an emergency. While we rely on  other forms of communication such as pagers and cell phones, they have  their short comings. Batteries die, pagers and cell phones are not on  the person, text messaging and smart phone apps like Active 911 could be  delayed, with some calls not coming through at all. The National Fire  Protection Association recommends that there are at least 2 reliable  means to alert firefighters. The siren gets the firefighters attention  at any time.</p>
<p>It says to everyone, somebody needs help! When people in town hear  the sirens, it tells them there&rsquo;s an emergency going on somewhere and it  helps with traffic. It warns citizens to be alert for volunteers  responding to the firehouse and to watch out for fire trucks responding  to an incident. When it&rsquo;s your time of emergency, a siren reassures you  that help is on the way!</p>
<p>Like the distance to the closest fire hydrant, fire sirens also help  with the cost of homeowner&rsquo;s insurance, counting as points toward a  better score on an Insurance Services Office evaluation. The higher the  score given to the fire department, the lower the insurance costs to the  homeowner!</p>
