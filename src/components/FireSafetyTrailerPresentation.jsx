<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="planning"><strong>MOST IMPORTANT: Getting out Alive</strong></h2>



<p><strong>In the Event of a Fire: When the detector goes off GET Out Fast Stay Low  and GO! </strong></p>



<p>Just as I’m talking to you,  two kids from Monroe are still alive because they were able to get out of a  burning house fire.<br></br>
</p>



<p>It’s about three things: <strong>Exits</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Alarms,  and having an Escape Plan.</strong>&nbsp;<br></br>
</p>



<p>Alarms:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smoke Detectors and Carbon Monoxide  Detectors</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Make sure that you have  at least one smoke detector on every level of the house.</li><li>Smoke  Detectors &amp; CO Detectors: &nbsp;Do video  game systems work with a dead battery? Neither do detectors.</li><li>Change detector batteries  when you change your clocks a minimum of once a year.</li></ul>



<p class="tab"><em><u>Adults Only Tip</u></em><em>: When discarding old batteries, put black  electrical tape over the top contacts to ensure a metal object hitting /  shorting out the contacts doesn’t accidentally cause a fire. </em></p>



<p>Some  newer smoke detectors and CO Detectors do not have replaceable batteries. After  the designed number years, the entire unit must be replaced.<br></br>
Test  smoke detectors monthly</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Replace if ten years or older.</li></ul>



<p>A bit about CO &amp; CO  detectors:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><u>Carbon  Monoxide Detectors:</u></strong></h2>



<p><strong><em>Carbon Monoxide is colorless,  odorless, tasteless and extremely harmful.</em></strong></p>



<p>You can’t see it, smell it,  or taste it.</p>



<p class="tab"><em><u>Adults Only Tips:</u></em></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><em>Test Carbon Monoxide detectors monthly.</em></li><li><em>Make sure you have at least one carbon monoxide  detector on every level of the house</em></li><li><em>Replace every five years unless it contains newer non-replaceable  battery as noted above.</em></li></ul>



<p><strong>Exits:</strong><br></br>
Know two ways out, both at  home and wherever you go.<br></br>
In the event of a Fire: </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>If one exit is  blocked, find another.</li><li>Exits are  doors and windows.</li><li>Plan and do  fire drills. Ensure that windows are operable and are big enough to get out of.  Do all windows open? Some have child proof locks </li><li>Identify exits in the home, including windows. </li><li>Check windows. Know how to open them and ensure that they  are big enough to get out of </li><li>Do you need a  ladder for escaping the second floor? If you have a ladder, just practice  setting it up, not going down. That’s what we have this trailer for!</li><li>Save the  practice for the fire safety trailer available at Monroe Day, the Oktoberfest,  and all third graders at school during Fire Prevention Week.</li><li>In  the event of a fire, use the ladder with one adult and have the children go  first. If there are two adults, one adult goes first, then the children, then  the second adult last.</li></ul>



<p class="tab"><em><u>Adults Only Tip:</u></em></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><em>Basement sleeping is hazardous without an  egress (escape window). Even a Bilco-type door can become covered with snow and  will block your escape.</em></li></ul>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><a href="#top">Back to the top</a></p>



<p><a id="escape"></a></p>



<h2 id="escape"><strong><u>Escape Plan/Home Fire Drills:</u></strong></h2>



<p>Make A Plan and do Fire  Drills: Just Like in School! </p>



<p>If you need assistance or  have a family member with special needs (wheelchair, etc.), contact the Fire  Dept. for a special plan.
</p>



<p>Fire is  dark, hot, and moves quickly, so you must have an escape plan. You have less  than three or four minutes to get out before the smoke, temperatures, and  carbon monoxide become unbearable.
</p>



<p>As said before, know two  ways out:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Know your  Exits (Windows and Doors).</li><li>Practice  opening windows. </li><li>Screens (in a  real fire) just push out.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Plan: </strong>All household members need to know how to get out  independently. Some fire drills should be conducted during sleeping hours and  can help to determine family members that have a tough time or are slow to wake  up. Use a spare smoke detector by holding down the test button to simulate a  real fire. Fire is dark, so a flashlight by your bedside may be helpful.</p>



<p>Part  of the drill should include instructions: </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Instruct family members: if there is smoke, stay low and go.</li><li>Identify a meeting place for family members to assemble at outside, such as a neighbor&#8217;s  front door or a tree in the front yard (away from the house). You can then  determine any missing people and direct firemen accordingly.</li><li>Instruct family members to <strong>NEVER go back inside once outside!</strong><strong> </strong></li><li>Call 9-1-1 from outside the house or a neighbor’s house,  NEVER from inside the house!<strong> </strong></li></ul>



<p><strong>Escape:&nbsp;&nbsp; When the alarm goes off, GET OUT! (Young  Kids: don’t hide from the Fire!)<br></br>
</strong><br></br>
Escape: When the alarm sounds, wake up the household  members, get out, and stay out!<strong> </strong></p>



<p>Time: You don’t have time! </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Just Enough  Time to wake up the family and Get Out!<ul>
<li>Pets get out by themselves, as they are low  to the ground.</li>
<li>No time for toys, valuables, or purses.</li>
</ul></li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Fire goes from  100 degrees to 400 – 1000 in the first three or four minutes of a fire.</li><li>Do not waste  time getting valuables. If you see fire or heavy smoke, or if the doorknob is  hot, keep the door shut and use a different way to get out. </li><li>If you must turn  around and use a bedroom window, use the escape ladder (climb down facing the  ladder) or go out feet first facing the house, hang and drop. </li><li>If you must go  through smoke, stay low by crawling under the smoke. That&#8217;s where the cool air  is. The difference may save your life!</li></ul>



<p>Stay low and go: That’s  where the cool air is, near the floor. That’s also why pets get out and survive. </p>



<p>Seaton Hall Dorm Fire  Example:<br></br>
Two college roommates escaped  the Seaton Hall Dorm Fire.<br></br>
One ran and the other  remembered her Fire Prevention training and crawled. <br></br>
The first went to St.  Barnabus with burns to their throat and lungs.<br></br>
The one who crawled was  treated and released the same day.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li> Try getting out the usual way. If there is  heavy smoke or fire, or if the door knob is hot, keep the door shut and again, find  another exit.</li><li>If you can’t  get out of bedroom, keep the door shut and go to a window. Open the window (unless  fire is below window) and wait for fire fighters. </li><li>If you must  get out through a window (if smoke is unbearable/last resort) but you don’t  have a ladder:<ul>
<li>Most home 2nd floor windows are  less than a 16 foot drop.</li>
<li>Teach family members how to hang like on a jungle  gym facing the building, dropping feet first, never jumping head-first.</li>
</ul></li><li>Once outside,  go to the meeting place and NEVER go back inside.</li><li>Call 9-1-1  from outside building or a neighbor’s house, never from inside the house.</li><li>Determine if  anyone is missing and direct Fire Dept.</li></ul>



<p>Note:&nbsp; Firefighters sometimes risk their lives  searching for people who are already out of the building.</p>



<p><u>Smoke Trailer Escape (True  Story):</u><br></br>
Explain that two kids  escaped a house fire in Monroe.<br></br>
A space heater caught a  vacuum cleaner on fire. <br></br>
A smoke detector alarm  went off.<br></br>
The teenage boy and girl  tried to go downstairs and saw smoke and fire.<br></br>
Just as they were taught,  they opened a window (no ladder), pushed out the screen, hung out the window,  and dropped. Both kids were ok (aside from the girl having a minor sprained  ankle). The house was totally destroyed.<br></br>
They survived because they  did everything right and didn’t lose their cool. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Smoke Drill/ Safety First!:</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Explain that you are going to recreate the  Monroe Fire Incident that you just talked about.</li><li>Teach how to use the ladder (Just like a pool  ladder).</li><li>Face trailer / house </li><li>Two hands and at least one foot on the  ladder, (three points just like fire school).</li><li>Children are instructed to crawl when smoke  alarm goes off, going to the upstairs window, turning to the ladder facing the  trailer (one at a time), and go down.</li><li>Have someone at the top of the ladder directing  the children, as well as crew at base of the ladder.</li><li>Children are to be directly supervised always.</li><li>Don’t touch the children unless you have to,  but under the same token, assist as necessary if you feel there is a safety  issue.</li></ul>
