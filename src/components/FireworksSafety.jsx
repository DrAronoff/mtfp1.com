                            <p>On June 28, 2018, a New Jersey Fireworks Bill became law.<br></br>
                    Items include: fireworks such as&nbsp;sparklers, ground-based sparklers, and novelty items such as party poppers and snappers.&nbsp; </p>
                    <p>All other fireworks will remain illegal in New Jersey, including all explosive and aerial fireworks such as firecrackers, sky rockets, and bottle rockets.</p>
                    <p>BE CAREFUL! </p>
                    <p>• Be safe. If you want to see fireworks, we recommend that you go to a public show put on by experts. <br></br>
                    The safest way to enjoy fireworks is to attend a public display conducted by trained professionals<br></br>
                    such as the one in Thompson Park, Monroe Township conducted every July 4th.</p>
                    <p>• Consumer fireworks such as sparklers, although now legal in New Jersey, have risks. The NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) reports that sparklers burn hot enough to cause third-degree burns.</p>
                    <p>• Fireworks cause an average of almost 18,500 reported fires per year. </p> 
                    <p>• Sparklers account for roughly one-quarter of emergency room fireworks injuries.</p>
