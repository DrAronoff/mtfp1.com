            <p><strong>Dear Resident</strong>: On behalf of the <strong>Fire Prevention  Bureau and Fire Department</strong>, the following information packet is has been  sent to <strong>help us help you</strong>.</p><br></br>



<p><strong>In  the Event of a Fire/</strong><strong>Getting Out  Alive</strong>: &nbsp;It’s all about <strong>Exits</strong> and <strong>Alarms. </strong>Fire  is dark, hot, and moves quickly, so you must have an escape plan. You have less  than 3 or 4 minutes to get out before the smoke, temperatures, and carbon  monoxide become unbearable. </p><br></br>



<p><strong><font size="+2">Alarms:<br></br></font></strong>&nbsp;Smoke detectors are needed on each level of  your home and especially outside of sleeping areas. They must work. Place them  on the ceiling a minimum of 4 to 6 inches from the wall. Too many times the  Fire Department has responded to a house without a working smoke detector.</p><br></br>



<p>Change your smoke detector batteries (and carbon monoxide detector batteries) when you change your clocks. Carbon monoxide detectors are a must. Having a minimum of one in each sleeping area; and, as prices have dropped, all levels of the house is a strong recommendation. Carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless. A malfunctioning appliance or a nest on top of a chimney can be deadly. Other alarms such as gas detectors are now available. If you smell gas, get out and call 911.  Specially designed detectors for the hearing or visually impaired are available for special situations. </p><br></br>



<p><strong><font size="+2">Exits:<br></br></font></strong> Plan and do fire drills. Know at least two exits from each level of your home. Ensure that windows are operable and are big enough to get out of. A chain ladder may be needed for upper levels of your house. Practice setting up the ladder. I do not recommend that you practice going down it. Note: students practice going down a ladder using the fire safety trailer available which is available to all third grades during school hours.</p><br></br>



<p>Basement sleeping is hazardous without an egress (escape window). Even a Bilco-type door can become covered with snow and will block your escape.</p><br></br>



<p><strong><font size="+2">Plan:<br></br></font></strong> All household  members need to know how to get out independently. Some fire drills should be  conducted during sleeping hours and can help to determine family members that  have a hard time or are slow to wake up. Use a spare smoke detector by holding  down the test button to simulate a real fire. A flashlight by your bedside may  be helpful, as fire is dark. Determine a meeting place such as a neighbor’s front  door or a tree in the front yard (away from the house). You can then determine  any missing people and direct firemen.</p><br></br>



<p><strong><font size="+2">Escape:<br></br></font></strong>&nbsp; When the alarm sounds, wake up household  members and get out and stay out! Do not waste time getting valuables. If you  see fire or heavy smoke or if the doorknob is hot, use a different way to get  out.&nbsp; If you must turn around and use a  bedroom window, use the escape ladder (climb down facing the ladder) or go out  feet first facing the house, hang and drop. If you must go through smoke, stay  low by crawling under the smoke. That’s where the cool air is. The difference  may save your life.&nbsp; Go to the meeting  place and do not go back inside for any reason. Call from the neighbor’s house  or meeting place, not inside the burning building. Always call 911, even for  the smallest fire that you thought you put completely out. The fire department  can check behind the wall electronically for heat (not an axe) for any  additional or extension of the fire. </p><br></br>



<p><strong><font size="+2">Selling or Renting Your  House?</font></strong><br></br>
  Your house <strong>must be inspected</strong> before you close if you  are moving or before a renter can move in and any subsequent change of  occupancy. You must have a smoke detector on each level of your house as well  as a carbon monoxide detector. As a result of a recently adopted law, you must  also have a fire extinguisher. The requirements are:<br></br></p><br></br>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>At least one portable fire extinguisher shall be  installed in all one-and-two-family detached dwellings upon change of  occupancy;</li>



<li>The extinguisher shall be listed, labeled, charged,  and operable;</li>



<li>The size shall be no smaller than 2A:10B:C and no  larger than 10lbs;</li>



<li>Must use hangers, or in brackets supplied by the  manufacturer;</li>



<li>Within 10 feet of the kitchen area;</li>



<li>Located with the top of the extinguisher not more  than 5’ above the floor;</li>



<li>Visible and in a readily-accessible spot, free from  blocking by furniture, storage, equipment and other items;</li>



<li>Near a room exit or travel way that provides an  escape route to the exterior;</li>



<li>Accompanied by an owner’s manual or written  information regarding the operation, inspection, and maintenance of the  extinguisher; and</li>



<li>Installed so the operation instructions shall be  clearly visible.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Stop by the Fire  House (located on Harrison Ave.  near Woodland School) for details, pick up an  application, and schedule an inspection.</strong></p><br></br>



<p>Fire Prevention Tips are attached. Please read them and  take a tour of your home. Call if you have any questions.</p><br></br>



<p>Further: Free Voluntary Home Fire Inspections<br></br>
  The Bureau is starting a new program of Home Fire Safety  Inspections in an effort to reduce the amount of residential fires. The free  inspection will be conducted in the evening hours by licensed fire inspectors.  Call to set up an appointment. </p><br></br>



<p>Special  Program for homes with fire alarms monitored by an outside alarm company: &nbsp;For homes that have a smoke detector and  burglar alarm system, the Bureau is offering a program where the homeowner can  purchase a safe-like box (called a <strong>Knox Box</strong>) to be cemented into your  house, wired to the burglar alarm, that contains a set of keys to get into your  house in the event of a fire or alarm activation. This allows us to gain <strong>rapid  entry </strong>without taking an axe to your door. This not only reduces damage but  also allows us to re-lock the door in the event of a false alarm without you  having to leave work. In the event of a fire, rescuing people and pets is  accomplished much quicker. Again, call the office for details.</p><br></br>
