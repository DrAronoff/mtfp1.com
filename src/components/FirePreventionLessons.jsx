<p>Greetings from the Monroe Fire Department District I. Here is our website: <a href="https://www.mtfp1.com">http://www.mtfp1.com</a><br></br>These pages are designed to mirror the presentations similar to those presented during assemblies.</p>



<p>Please review concepts and teach according as appropriate to the understanding of each class.</p>



<p>Each Grade level has an age-appropriate video to watch. Just click on the link!</p>



<p>Notes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Stop Drop and Roll is taught separately, preferably in gym class. Too many times, students confused the concepts with answering &#8220;Stop, drop, and roll&#8221; for when the smoke detector goes off.</li>
</ul>



<p>Questions and answers have always been an important of our Assemblies. We are compiling a list of questions and will be happy to include new ones.</p>



<p>Please submit your questions to <a href="mailto:Monroebofc@aol.com">Monroebofc@aol.com</a></p>

<p>Stay safe, on behalf of the Fire Fighters from Monroe&nbsp;Twp. District 1.</p>
