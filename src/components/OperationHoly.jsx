            <p><strong>Operation Holy Smokes is a program  designed to distribute smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors to local  places of worship for those in need of assistance. It is also designed to  provide Fire Prevention information in the form of a basic checklist. The  checklist allows worshipers to go back into their homes and do home inspections  that include checking smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors and  identifying exits.</strong></p>
